POLITICO TAKE HOME ASSIGNMENT
============

A few notes... I scaffolded this project using a tool called Yeoman (http://yeoman.io/) and one of the many generators available.  I use this tool to quickly start up small projects, add a gulpfile, basic folder structure, etc.

If you'd like to run this locally, you can clone down or fork this repo, run `npm install` and then `gulp serve` to launch the page.

Hope you like it!
